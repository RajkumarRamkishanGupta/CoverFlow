# AndroidStudio-CoverViewWithViewPager


It's an animation of a list of 'cards' (pages) when scroll a ViewPager and in the first commit with drawable images and in the second commit with picasso to show the images through URLs. 

In view of that https://github.com/moondroid/CoverFlow is becoming obsolete. Using this tutorial https://teachmeandroidhub.blogspot.com/2018/10/android-tutorial-how-to-create-view.html, I have grouped the code to make it easier to implement and improve it and adjust it as the code of 'moondroid'
